# ðŸ©º Skin Lesion Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to develop an automated skin lesion detection system using deep learning to assist in early diagnosis of skin cancer, including melanoma. The system processes dermoscopic images and classifies them into various lesion types using a trained convolutional neural network.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Deep learning-based image classification
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Streamlit-based web interface for user interaction
- Option to predict from uploaded images

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: [ResNet50 / EfficientNet / Custom CNN]
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch
- **Input**: RGB dermoscopic image
- **Output**: Class label (e.g., Melanoma, Nevus, Seborrheic Keratosis)

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

- Source: [ISIC 2018 / HAM10000 / Custom dataset]
- Number of Images: ~10,000
- Image Size: 224x224 (resized during preprocessing)

> **Note**: Dataset is used only for educational and research purposes.
